# CertiFy

CertiFy is a blockchain-backed certificate verification app. The inspiration for such an app came from the immediate need to curb the fake certificates that can be easily made with decent skills.

The conventional process of verify certificates usually involves lots of bureaucracy and that involves a lot of time.

Our system is proof that blockchain coupled with Supabase's awesome features can help solve this issue.

We've currently deployed this using a local blockchain using Truffle and Ganace. But we're very confident that we can migrate this to the mainnet (actual blockchain like Ethereum or Polygon) within a couple steps.

## Features

The app has 2 main components: The organizer and the person.

- The organizer can issue certificates (currently in pdf) to a person using their email.
- The certificates issued to a person can be viewed in their screen and also the name of organization issuing it will be seen.
- The smart contract (written using Solidity) is used to run on any EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible blockchain.
- When a certificate is added, the hash of the student email, org email and a hash of the pdf contents is computed. These details are stored on SupaBase and the pdf itself is stored on SupaBase storage.
- We also store these hash on the blockchain using the smart contract and the corresponding transaction hash is stored on SupaBase.
- The transaction hash makes it possible for anyone to verify the authenticity manually by entering the hash into a website such as getblock.io (blockchain explorers).
- Each certificate has an extra variable in the smart contract to denote if the certificate is revoked or not.
- When the certificate issued by an org is deleted by the org, the entry is removed from db and file is also deleted.
- We modify the certificate details on blockchain by setting the revoked variable to true.
- Whenever verify certificate is called, our contract returns true if a certificate hash for a particular organisation is linked to a participant student's hash.
- If such a certificate exists and the revoked is false, then the function returns true indicating the certificate is valid.
- In the Verify screen that anyone can open, the user has to enter all the details linked to the certificate. The hashes are computed again and checked using the verify function which reads the data from blockchain and returns a Boolean value.
- For every valid certificate, we will also show the corresponding hash so a user can manually verify.

## Installation

To install and run this project locally, you need to have Truffle, Ganache, Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

1. Clone this repository: `https://github.com/AryanSarafDev/supaverify.git`
2. Navigate to the project folder.
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start Ganache and create a workspace with your project folder and add `lib/contracts/truffle-config.js` in workspace.
5. Create .env file.
6. Copy your contract address from Ganache and paste it in .env: PRIVATE_KEY = "*Here*"
7. Create a Supabase project and copy your API URL and public key from Settings > API and paste it in .env: SUPABASE_URL = "*Here*" & SUPABASE_KEY = "*Here*" .

8. Create table named `everyone` in Supabase with the following columns: `id`, `username`,`created_at`, `isorg`,`iper`, `uid`, `oid`, `email`.
9. Create table named `organization` in Supabase with the following columns: `id`, `filename`,`created_at`, `certname`, `certificate`, `hashval`, `transhash`, `orgemail`,`orgname`,`uid`, `oid`, `email`.
10. Compile and deploy the smart contract by opening terminal at `lib/contracts` : `truffle compile` and `truffle migrate`
11. Run the app on your emulator and enjoy!
## Schemas for table
# everyone:

create table
public.everyone (
id bigint generated by default as identity not null,
created_at timestamp with time zone null default now(),
uid text not null default ''::text,
username text not null default ''::text,
isorg boolean null default false,
isper boolean null default false,
oid text null default ''::text,
email text null default ''::text,
constraint everyone_pkey primary key (id)
) tablespace pg_default;

## organization:
create table
public.organization (
id bigint generated by default as identity not null,
created_at date null,
email text null default ''::text,
certificate text null default ''::text,
uid text null default ''::text,
oid text null default ''::text,
certname text null default ''::text,
orgname text null default ''::text,
hashval text null,
filename text null default ''::text,
orgemail text null default ''::text,
transhash text null,
constraint organization_pkey primary key (id)
) tablespace pg_default;


## Usage

To use this app as an organizer or a person, you need to sign up with your email and password using Supabase Auth.

### As an organizer

- You can create certificates by filling out a form with the student's email and uploading a pdf file of the certificate.
- You can view all the certificates you have issued in a table.
- You can revoke or delete any certificate you have issued by clicking on the corresponding buttons in the table.

### As a person

- You can view all the certificates you have received in a table with their details and status (valid or revoked).
- You can download any certificate you have received by clicking on the download button in the table.

### As anyone

- You can verify any certificate by entering its student email, org email and cert hash, in a form.
- You can see if the certificate is valid or not based on the result of verifying its hashes on both Supabase and blockchain.
